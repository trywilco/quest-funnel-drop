learningObjectives:
- Reproducing a bug locally 
hints:
- All modern web browsers can show you what your website looks like on mobile, so
  you'll be able to easily debug and develop for mobile. You can use the developer
  tools to see it.
- This is probably the url of the page where users can choose to follow other users.

      - text: "Only, you know, don’t—you might break something."
        delay: 1400
      - text: "It’s not that I don’t trust you, but the management definitely doesn’t, so please begin by :instruction[reproducing the bug in your dev environment]."
        delay: 3500
      - text: "After reproduced, :instruction[send me the URL of the path] where you saw the issue. Then we’ll try to fix it in your dev environment, and only if it works, we’ll fix it in production."
